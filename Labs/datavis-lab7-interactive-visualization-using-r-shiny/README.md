# DV Lab 7 - Ishaan Shrivastava [B20AI013]

I have done and reproduced all the tutorials in the `lesson1`, `lesson2`, `lesson3`, `lesson4`, `lesson5`, `lesson6`, and `lesson7` folders.

For the custom visualization, the code of which is included in the `nuclearvis` folder, I have downloaded poublicly-available nuclear explosion data for the years 1945-1998 from [this publicly available .csv file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-08-20/nuclear_explosions.csv).


## Custom Task - `nuclearVis`
I tried to publish this as a page to R Shiny Cloud, however I was unable to due to an error that I was unable to debug. 

I have attached a screenshot of the rendered output when the app is run, below:

The app features an interactive scatterplot on a world map to show the locations and explosion yield of nuclear explosions throughout history.

You can interact with the app by zooming in / out in order to adjust the level of detail. 

I have used a very specific combination of colors and styles in my scatterplot in order to tackle the challenging task of visualizing the highly dense nature of explosions without sacrificing on the level of detail. 

Zooming in and out can be used to examine local areas in detail.

## Publishing a Page
As this part requires us to publish a page to a URL, I have published my attempt at reproducing `lesson5` as the `nuclearVis` app could not be hosted due to some errors.

Below is an image showing how the page should look after it is published:
